# title-updater

This is a small python script that we use for updating song and artist information to send them over the Radio Data System (RDS) to update the dynamic radiotext.

The script is running on a Raspberry Pi with an attached PiFace. The PiFace is connected to the audiorouter. So the script can determine which audiosource is currently broadcasting and fetch the correct song and artist information.
